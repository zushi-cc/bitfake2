# Bitfake
Bitfake was originally created to detect fake `.FLAC` files through spectral analysis. It has since grown into a multipurpose CLI tool for handling music more easily and efficiently.

One common problem was that getting a track's metadata required long `ffprobe` commands with messy output. Converting music with `ffmpeg` was also repetitive. The command itself is easy to remember, but writing scripts to convert entire directories felt inefficient and slow. This project now performs metadata and conversion tasks directly through linked libraries (TagLib/libsndfile/libav*).

# Latest Version (1.8)

1.8 brings a lot of compatibility between other distros and operating systems, thanks to @eatingzushigonewild, there is now support on \*BSD and installing on/with the Nix package manager is now easier. The release will not have it so you will have to run `git clone` to clone the project before building; regardless, shout out to them for making it easier to use this program on a multitude of operating systems.

## Implemented Features
* Get metadata
* Get ReplayGain info (useful for music players)
* Spectral analysis on 44.1 kHz `.FLAC` files (higher sample rates may be misrepresented, so be careful)
* Lossy diagnosis (banding score)
* File Conversion (Works for outputs like `.wav`, `.flac`, `.ogg`, `.mp3`, `.aac`, `.opus`)
* Tagging metadata (Works for single files, but not directories yet)
* Calculating ReplayGain and applying it to files (Works for track replay gain iterating through directories, album replay gain is a bit funky?)
* Directory Conversion (works for all previously mentioned formats!)
* CoverArt+ (Brings along cover art among all conversions!)
* Organizing Files by album! (Give a dir of random music, and bitfake will organize it - ty to uncognic)
* Directory Tagging (YAY!)
* Spectrogram generation (in .png)
* Version info (WOW! BEST YET!)

## Implemented Development Features
These features are meant to make contributing to the project easier:
* Global header file for simpler global variable declarations
* `ConsoleOut` header file for organized output
* Two-stage metadata add/overwrite flow
* Separation of non-user, helper, and core functions for organization
* File checking functions for specific use cases (audio extension checks, magic number checks, and specific format checks)

## Yet to Be Implemented
* GPU Accelerated actions (converting, analyzing, etc.) (Likely 2.0)
* MusicBrainz syncing via ID or song title/artist/album. (Likely 2.0 as well)
* Remaking `main.cpp` so the CLI is much easier to use
* Many Fixes to converting songs
* More to be added later

NixOS:

Users that are using npins:
```sh
npins add github Ray17x bitfake2 --branch main
```
Then add to your system packages:
```nix
let
  sources = import ../npins/default.nix;
in {
  environment.systemPackages = [
    (pkgs.callPackage "${sources.bitfake2}/package.nix" {})
  ];
}
```
> [!NOTE]
> This might differ to other people's npins configuration but mostly should be the same.

Users that are using flakes, add this to your flake.nix:
```nix
inputs.bitfake2.url = "github:Ray17x/bitfake2";
```
Then add to your system packages:
```nix
environment.systemPackages = [ inputs.bitfake2.packages.${pkgs.system}.default ];
```

2. Clone the project and compile

Using `git clone`:
```sh
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/Ray17x/bitfake2.git
cd bitfake2
make
```

3. Running
```sh
./bitf -h
```
(Help command to get you started!)

## Usage Examples

Print help:
```sh
./bitf -h
```

Get metadata (prints to terminal by default):
```sh
./bitf -i /path/to/song.flac -gmd
```

Get metadata and write to a text file (`-o` must be a `.txt` file):
```sh
./bitf -i /path/to/song.flac -gmd -o /tmp/metadata.txt
```

Get ReplayGain info:
```sh
./bitf -i /path/to/song.flac -grg
```

Run spectral analysis:
```sh
./bitf -i /path/to/song.flac -sa
```

Note: For some commands, `-i` can also be a directory path, and Bitfake will process supported audio files inside it.

4. Cleaning up project

You can clean the project and prepare for a fresh build with:
```sh
make clean
```

## Code Style

This project uses `clang-format` with the repository config in `.clang-format` (same-line/K&R braces).

Format all C++ source/header files:
```sh
make format
```

Check formatting without modifying files (useful for CI):
```sh
make check-format
```

You are now ready to build the project again with any additions or contributions you make.

This project is not yet released in any distribution package manager as a raw binary. If you want to run the binary as a command, copy it to your `/usr/bin` directory like this (NOT RECOMMENDED):
```sh
sudo cp ./bitf /usr/bin/
```

## Troubleshooting

Linker errors like `cannot find -lavformat`, `cannot find -lavcodec`, `cannot find -lavutil`, or `cannot find -lswresample`:
* Install FFmpeg development packages for your distro (`ffmpeg-devel`, `ffmpeg-dev`, or `libav*-dev` packages).

Linker errors like `cannot find -ltag`, `cannot find -lfftw3`, `cannot find -lebur128`, or `cannot find -lsndfile`:
* Install the TagLib/FFTW3/libebur128/libsndfile *development* packages for your distro (not just the runtime libs).

Build fails due to missing headers:
* Confirm you installed TagLib, FFTW3, libebur128, libsndfile, and FFmpeg/libav development packages and are using a C++17 compiler.
